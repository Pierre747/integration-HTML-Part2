# HTML integration - Part✌🏻

My second HTML integration using a blueprint of two different results that would respectively fits :

 - The Browser

 - A Smartphone


The blueprints are available in the folder :
```bash
assets > sketch > ...
```
The goal was to work with the display grid and the media queries in order to produce a simple responsive integration. This one was more challenging than the first one.
I had to manage multiple elements in a bigger project.
